    <div class="center-fish">
        <img src="images/bluegill.gif" class="img-fish" />
        <h3 class="center-fish-name w-100">Bluegill</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="txt-fish w-100">Bluegills feed almost exclusively on insects
        and will also eat commercial fish food.
        Bluegills begin to spawn in late spring and
        will spawn 3-4 times throughout the summer.
        These spawn are primarily used as a forage
        base for predators, such as large mouth bass.
        One year old fish range in size from
        1 - 4 inches and become sexually mature
        between 4 - 5 inches.</p>

    <h3>Hybrid Bluegills</h3>
    <p class="txt-fish w-100">Hybrid Bluegills are a cross between a
        green sunfish and a bluegill. They grow faster than regular
        bluegill. They will also eat commercial food.
        Their spawning habits are like the bluegill
        however they produce less eggs. One year old range in
        size from 3 - 8 inches. They become sexually mature at
        4 - 5 inches.</p>

    <div class="center-fish">
        <h3 class="center-fish-name w-100"> Redear Sunfish</h3>
        <img src="images/redearSunfish.gif" class="img-fish" />
    </div>
    <p class="txt-fish">Redear Sunfish, nicknamed the Shellcracker, is a member of the
        sunfish family and similar to the bluegill.
        It feeds almost exclusively on mollusks.
        These are fast growing and fun to catch.
        They reproduce one time a year therefore
        they will not overpopulate a pond.
        One year olds range from 1 - 4 inches and become
        sexually mature between 5 - 9 inches.</p>

    <div class="center-fish">
        <img src="images/lrgMouthBass.gif" class="img-fish" />
        <h3 class="center-fish-name w-100"> Large Mouth Bass</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="txt-fish">Large Mouth Bass, one of the most priced game fish,
        readily do not feed on commercial fish food.
        They eat insects, tadpoles, minnows and other small fish.
        They spawn in 2 - 4 feet of water at temperatures
        near 60 degrees. One year old fish range in size
        between 3 - 7 inches and become
        sexually mature at 10 - 12 inches.</p>

    <h3>Hybrid Striped Bass</h3>
    <p class="txt-fish">Hybrid Striped Bass are a cross between a
        striped and white bass. The result is a voracious eater that
        can grow one to three pounds per year and may grow to be as
        large as 16 pounds in Ohio. This fish is sterile eliminating
        overpopulation and takes well to commercial fish food. Can
        effectively control the overpopulation of Bluegill.</p>

    <div class="center-fish">
        <h3 class="center-fish-name w-100">Channel Catfish</h3>
        <img src="images/channelCatfish.gif" class="img-fish" />
    </div>
    <p class="txt-fish">Channel Catfish are scavengers that will eat almost
        anything and are primarily found at the bottom of a pond or
        lake. They will easily take to commercial feed which results
        in tremendous growth. They generally do not reproduce in
        ponds due to inadequate spawning structure. Suitable
        structures are buckets or drain tiles place in 3 - 4 foot
        water depths.</p>

    <div class="center-fish">
        <img src="images/yPerch.gif" class="img-fish" />
        <h3 class="center-fish-name w-100">Yellow Perch</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="txt-fish">Yellow Perch is sought after for the good tasting fillets.
        Their primary food is zoo plankton, insects, snails and
        small fish. They are considered prey rather than predators.
        Reproduction occurs on tree-like structures in water depths
        of 1 - 6 feet. One year old fish range in
        size from 1 - 4 inches and become sexually mature at 5 - 12
        inches.</p>

    <h3>Triploid White Amur</h3>
    <p class="txt-fish">Triploid White Amur, or the Grass Carp, is a
        cost effective, natural alternative for weed control in ponds.
        The use of amur in place of chemical applications is more
        environmentally friendly. Once an amur reaches maturity it
        consumes less, therefore 20% of the original stocking should
        be added annually. They can eat up to 3 times its body weight
        per day. These fish are sterile due to government regulations
        to avoid overpopulation.</p>

    <div class="center-fish">
        <h3 class="center-fish-name w-100">Black Fathead Minnow</h3>
        <img src="images/blackFatheadMinnow.gif" class="img-fish" />
    </div>
    <p class="txt-fish">Black Fathead Minnows are added to ponds as a source of
        food for other species. They can spawn many times throughout
        the spring and summer. The use of stacked pallets and
        trees can create spawning habitats.
        One year olds range in size from .5 - 3 inches and become
        sexually mature at 1 - 3 inches.
        Restocking is necessary if none are visible in pond.</p>
