                <p class="txt-fish">Do not allow anyone to place fish from other bodies of water
                    in your pond. Fish caught in the wild carry parasites or disease
                    and will also destroy the forage fish population affecting the
                    overall balance of the pond.</p>

                <p class="txt-fish">Adding minnows will promote faster fish growth and provide food
                    throughout the winter months. Do not purchase bait minnows
                    because they are usually wild caught and are likely to contain
                    undesirable fish, like carp ad bullheads or diseases.</p>

                <p class="txt-fish">Place structure in pond to provide protection for smaller fish.
                    Items that make good structures are Xmas trees, pallets, and
                    tree tops.</p>

                <p class="txt-fish">To maximize fish growth, begin a feeding program within a few
                    days of stocking. The bass species are live feeders so stocking
                    minnows in the spring and fall is recommended.</p>

                <p class="txt-fish">When fishing, put a size limit on fish to be kept and fish out a
                    balanced number of each species.</p>

                environmentally friendly. Once an amur reaches maturity it
                consumes less, therefore 20% of the original stocking should
                be added annually. They can eat up to 3 times its body weight
