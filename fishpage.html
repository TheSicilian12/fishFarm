        <h3 class="center-fish-name w-100">Bluegill</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="txt-fish w-100">Bluegills feed almost exclusively on insects
        and will also eat commercial fish food.
        Bluegills begin to spawn in late spring and
        will spawn 3-4 times throughout the summer.
        These spawn are primarily used as a forage
        base for predators, such as large mouth bass.
        One year old fish range in size from
        1 - 4 inches and become sexually mature
        between 4 - 5 inches.</p>

        <img src="images/blackFatheadMinnow.gif" class="img-fish" />
    </div>
    <p class="txt-fish">Black Fathead Minnows are added to ponds as a source of
        food for other species. They can spawn many times throughout
        the spring and summer. The use of stacked pallets and
        trees can create spawning habitats.
        One year olds range in size from .5 - 3 inches and become
        sexually mature at 1 - 3 inches.
        Restocking is necessary if none are visible in pond.</p>

        <h3 class="center-fish-name w-100">Channel Catfish</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Channel Catfish are scavengers that will eat almost
        anything and are primarily found at the bottom of a pond or
        lake. They will easily take to commercial feed which results
        in tremendous growth. They generally do not reproduce in
        ponds due to inadequate spawning structure. Suitable
        structures are buckets or drain tiles place in 3 - 4 foot
        water depths.</p>
